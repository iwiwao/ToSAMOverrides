Tree of Savior Addon Manager addon install overrides

Stores information for addons that need to have settings assigned that cannot be derived via typical methods in the Addon Manager.  

For example, if you update an existing an addon, change it's name, but do not change the addon settings directory, the typical 
install will create the wrong addon directory.  This override file allows for manually setting the settings directory, assuring the 
proper directory is created.
